# Customer-Segmentation

Objective: The primary goal of this project is to segment customers based on their attributes to better understand target audiences and develop tailored marketing strategies.

Overview:

Understanding your customers is crucial for any business looking to enhance its marketing efforts and increase customer satisfaction. This project involves analyzing a customer dataset to identify distinct customer segments using SQL. By segmenting customers based on various attributes such as demographics, purchasing behavior, and engagement metrics, we can gain valuable insights into different customer groups. These insights enable businesses to develop targeted marketing strategies that resonate with each segment, ultimately improving marketing effectiveness and customer engagement.

Key Steps:

Data Import: Import the customer dataset into a SQL database from a provided CSV file. The dataset includes attributes such as customer demographics, purchasing history, and interaction data.

Data Exploration: Perform initial exploration to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies or outliers.

Data Cleaning: Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting any errors to ensure accurate analysis.

Segmentation Analysis: Use SQL queries to segment customers based on key attributes. Analyze customer behavior, preferences, and engagement to identify distinct groups.

Visualization: Create visualizations using Excel or data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to represent the customer segments clearly. Visualizations may include charts, graphs, and dashboards that highlight the characteristics and distribution of each segment.

Insights and Recommendations: Summarize the findings in a detailed report, including the business questions addressed, insights gained, and recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.

Tools Used:

SQL: For data manipulation, segmentation, and analysis.
Excel/Tableau/Power BI: For creating visualizations that represent the identified customer segments and their attributes.
Impact:

This project showcases the ability to perform comprehensive customer analysis using SQL and provides actionable insights that can drive strategic marketing decisions. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of each group, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and improved marketing ROI.
