Data Cleaning: Clean the data by removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and correcting errors to ensure accuracy in the analysis.

Segmentation Analysis: Utilize Excel formulas and pivot tables to segment customers based on relevant attributes. Apply sorting and filtering techniques to group customers and identify patterns.

Visualization: Create visualizations using Excel charts and graphs to represent the customer segments. This can include pie charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots that highlight the characteristics of each segment.

Insights and Recommendations: Summarize the findings in an Excel report, detailing the segmentation results and providing actionable recommendations for marketing strategies.
