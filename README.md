Furthermore, the top customers in terms of total sales and profit are primarily from the West and East regions, while the South and Central regions have more customers with lower sales and profit. Additionally, the Central region has the highest number of customers generating negative profits, indicating a need for further investigation.



**Conclusion**

The strong performance in the West and East regions suggests successful sales strategies that could be replicated in the South and Central regions. The high spending on Technology and Office Supplies suggests these categories are key revenue drivers, whereas the poor performance in Furniture needs attention. The issue of negative profits, particularly in the Central region, indicates underlying problems that must be addressed to enhance profitability. Strategic focus on these insights can help in improving overall business outcomes.
